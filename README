The program uses multithreading of n amount of threads to increment
an integer 1000 times.

Race Condition: A race condition happens when threads are processed
without waiting for previous threads to finish. An example of this
happening would be when a variable is incremented incorrectly because
the threads had incremented the variable before letting a previous thread
increment it, resulting in a number different than what the person wants.

Mutex: A mutex prevents race conditions from happening by only letting one
thread be allowed to process the code at a time. This happens by
typing what you want to happen in between the mutex's.
